        "description": "Russia announced its troops had finished withdrawing from a major city in southern Ukraine on Friday, clearing the way for victorious Ukrainian forces to reclaim the only provisional capital Russia captured during the nearly nine month war.\n\nIn a statement carried by Russian state news agencies, the ministry said the withdrawal was completed at 5am on Friday, and not a single unit of military equipment was left behind.\n\nITV News Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo said the developments today mark the \"most successful, most significant day for the Ukrainians so far‚Äù.\n\nVideos and photos on social media showed residents jubilantly taking to the streets and a Ukrainian flag flying over a monument in a central Kherson square for the first time since the city was seized in early March. Some footage showed crowds cheering on men in military uniform.\n\n‚Ä¢ Subscribe to ITV News on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2lOHmNj \r\n‚Ä¢ Get breaking news and more stories at http://www.itv.com/news\r\n\r\nFollow ITV News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itvnews/ \r\nFollow ITV News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itvnews \r\nFollow ITV News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itvnews/",

          "description": "Russia announced its troops had finished withdrawing from a major city in southern Ukraine on Friday, clearing the way for victorious Ukrainian forces to reclaim the only provisional capital Russia captured during the nearly nine month war.\n\nIn a statement carried by Russian state news agencies, the ministry said the withdrawal was completed at 5am on Friday, and not a single unit of military equipment was left behind.\n\nITV News Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo said the developments today mark the \"most successful, most significant day for the Ukrainians so far‚Äù.\n\nVideos and photos on social media showed residents jubilantly taking to the streets and a Ukrainian flag flying over a monument in a central Kherson square for the first time since the city was seized in early March. Some footage showed crowds cheering on men in military uniform.\n\n‚Ä¢ Subscribe to ITV News on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2lOHmNj \r\n‚Ä¢ Get breaking news and more stories at http://www.itv.com/news\r\n\r\nFollow ITV News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itvnews/ \r\nFollow ITV News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itvnews \r\nFollow ITV News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itvnews/"
